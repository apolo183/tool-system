## Definition

tool-system is a domain-agnostic software factory for controlled agentic development.

It coordinates agents, harness workflows, CI checks, patch generation, review gates, and repository write controls. It does not contain finance logic, trading logic, portfolio logic, market-data logic, or investment decision logic.

## System boundary

### In scope

- Parse machine-readable blueprints and execution specs.
- Decompose approved specs into bounded implementation tasks.
- Generate patches through controlled agents.
- Run tests, lint, type checks, and policy checks.
- Block writes when tests or policy checks fail.
- Create auditable repository changes.
- Collect pull request and workflow state for repo write decisions.
- Execute approved repository write actions through explicit controller gates.
- Validate downstream target-repository task manifests in dry-run mode.
- Prepare approved downstream target-repository pull-request write flows after explicit gates pass.
- Run local task-manifest and change-plan gates through productized runner commands.
- Plan bounded task graphs with dependency ordering and agent role assignments.
- Run role-assigned task graph steps through an auditable no-mutation runtime.
- Build no-mutation worker adapter contracts and orchestration records.
- Define and operate controlled target-repository PR pilot gates after explicit execution approval.
- Execute a real local process-backed worker inside a controlled fixture-only runtime after minimum safety gates pass.

### Out of scope

- Trading decisions.
- Alpha or factor design.
- Backtest interpretation.
- Portfolio allocation.
- Market-data ingestion.
- Direct modification of business-system rules without explicit approval.
- Production deployment without separate explicit approval.

## Current phase state

Current phase: `P12_DURABLE_ORCHESTRATOR`.

Status: `active`.

P10 was accepted as a successful controlled, no-production, draft-pull-request pilot. The acceptance demonstrates bounded target-repository planning, named execution approvals, fresh-state checks, exact file allowlists, draft PR creation, local validation handoff, fail-closed correction handling, audit evidence, and rollback references.

P10R is closed and P11 Real Worker Runtime is accepted at the local, fixture-only, application-guarded scope. P12 Durable Orchestrator is active. P13 Security and Reliability Hardening, P14 Multi-repo Benchmark, and P15 Production Operations and Acceptance remain roadmap-only until separately authorized.

P11 evidence proves an allowlisted Python fixture process with ephemeral workspace isolation, scrubbed environment, application-level network/process/file guards, resource limits, bounded output, timeout, cancellation, process-group termination, and cleanup. It does not prove hostile-code sandboxing, durable orchestration, remote target execution, or production readiness. Finance-us and every other remote target repository remain no-mutation, and production deployment remains prohibited.

P12 is limited to local SQLite fixture state and local in-process side-effect sinks. It must persist run/task state, resume expired leases safely, enforce idempotency and expected precondition SHAs, record side effects, commit outbox events transactionally, and reconcile replay without duplicate completion. It grants no remote side-effect or target-repository authority.

## Repository contract

This repository is a tool layer. Business systems are downstream targets. tool-system may propose and apply changes to target repositories only through explicit workflow, test, policy, review, execution-approval, and rollback gates.

P10 acceptance does not authorize unrestricted downstream mutation, target PR ready transition, target PR merge, production deployment, real external worker execution, or Codex replacement claims. Each such action remains separately gated.

Finance-us P1A is accepted, merged, strictly validated, and closed on target `main` at `7101847826e6701a4d8cc7f0a6208fb9aee2cc4e`. The finance-us P1B phase-entry record and implementation packet are prepared and merged in tool-system. P1B target implementation remains blocked pending a named, action-scoped target execution approval; P1B ready and merge remain separately gated.

The canonical active downstream identity is `apolo183/finance-us`. The legacy `apolo183/finance-os` route is retired and retained only as a closed, no-write compatibility fixture. Direct bootstrap on tool-system and finance-us is disabled, and downstream merge approval is bound to repository, action, base branch, and expected head SHA.
